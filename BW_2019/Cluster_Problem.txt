1.Tools and packages: scikit-learn, anaconda

2.Language: Python

3.After importing all the required packages, data is loaded in to pandas dataframes(train, test).

4.Added two features("headline", "text") to create a single feature("text_feature").

5.The feature with text value is handled with TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data to numeric form and then
to pandas dataframe and then selected only the top features.

7.Merged the dataframe with the newly created dataframe from text feature.

8.Tested different clustering algorithm to find the best model for the given data also found optimal value of number of
cluster with silhouette_score.

9.Using best clustering algorithm predicted the cluster label for each news id.
