       "Equifax mishandled my information, which has led to a violation that puts me and millions of others at a potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with the way in which Equifax has handled the notification of this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for almost a month after the violation was detected. I did not receive any email, letter or phone call and, instead, I had to discover it through social networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              13\n",

       "I have been a victim of identity theft. I have tried to work with the Credit Reporting Agency, but they refuse to honor my valid identity theft case, so these incorrect / fraudulent items are still on my credit report and should be removed immediately, but they do not belong to me. I have provided all the evidence to prove that I was a victim of identity theft and that, to my knowledge, these fraudulent accounts do not belong to me. Take immediate action on my behalf to be able to eliminate, delete and permanently block these elements of my credit report, so that I can return to normal.\\n\\nregards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               3\n",
       "In XXXX, I requested my free annual credit report. After seeing my credit report, I noticed more than XXXX credit / loan inquiries in my account that were not authorized by me. I contacted each company and was informed that there was no account opened under my information. I explained that I have a difficult question on my credit report and that I need to be removed as soon as possible in order to apply for housing. They told me that the queries would be deleted from my credit report. As of XXXX / XXXX / XXXX, none of the queries has been deleted since XXXX. I received an initial fraud alert on my XXXX XXXX report, so if the company contacted me with a credit report, the company would contact me before a decision was made. I just want the queries to be deleted so that my score and credit will no longer be affected. I would like to buy a house, but until all inquiries are eliminated, I will not be approved with XXXX queries on my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3\n",

Je n'ai reçu aucun courrier électronique, lettre ou appel téléphonique, mais j'ai dû le découvrir via les médias sociaux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      3\n",
       "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. Months have passed and I still have not received an answer to my concerns. The only thing I have received is an automatic rejection letter stating that they did not do anything to help me (see the attached document).\\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I've already wasted a lot of time trying to get Experian to see the errors on my credit report and I'm so frustrated that Experian is not responding to my questions intentionally. I need to have this problem solved immediately. There are many things that I have to do with my life and they all involve my credit.

       "A few months ago I applied for my credit report to Experian. I received this letter from them telling me that they received something that looked like fraud. I did not have the opportunity to call them immediately and, honestly, I thought it was a mistake, so I connected and got my report from some website.\\nI ended up filing some disputes because there was incorrect and incomplete information on my credit report. So I prepared a good letter and sent it with a copy of my driver's license, proof of my social security number and proof of my email address so that Experian can verify my identity.\\nIt has been at least 2 months since I sent my letter and I have not received a response. When I try to call their number XXXX, they want a report number before talking to an agent and, since I do not have one, I can not talk to anyone.\\nI thought that the credit companies had to answer me within 30 days, otherwise, are you supposed to eliminate things from my credit report?\\nWell, it's been more than 30 days and all the things I've discussed are still there. I know I can connect online, buy a credit monitoring service and try to dispute things online, but I thought Experian should help me for free!\\nI'm at the point where I've finished wasting my time and I need to fix it right away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3\n",

It was in postponement, so the final notices must be deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 3\n",

       "While reviewing my personal credit report, I noticed an unauthorized and fraudulent credit request made by XXXX on or around XX / XX / XXXX in Transunion. I did not authorize any person employed by this company to make any inquiries and see my credit report. XXXX has violated Law 1681b (c) of the Fair Credit Information Act.

This is a serious violation of my privacy rights.\\nI have requested that you send me a copy of my signed authorization form that gave you the right to see my credit within five (5) business days to verify its validity and I informed you that if you can not provide proof that I authorized you to see my credit report, then I demand that they contact the credit bureaus immediately and ask them to immediately withdraw the unauthorized and fraudulent query. I also asked them to remove my personal information from their records. My social security number is XXXX and my date of birth is XX / XX / XXXX in case it is necessary to locate the fraudulent query on your system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                3\n",

I still do not know the extent of the damage and you may never know it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "My Chase card says that you have a balance transfer option. But I have never been able to transfer a balance and in the XXXX to four years that I have had this card I have not been offered a balance transfer agreement. I am not receiving the full service of this card without the option to transfer a balance. I want to be able to do this, Chase needs to solve this problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",

       "To: Citizens Bank XXXX Rhode Island; XXXX XXXX I file a complaint with the Citizens bank as follows: I am writing to report all that has occurred due to the incompetence of the Citizens bank XXXX Rhode Island.\\nThe XXXX XXXX, when I connected online to register my vehicle, I could not do it. Then, I called the registration office and they informed me that my registration was suspended, since the title was never received for the new owner of the XXXX embargo. I was completely unaware that I was suspended. I called XXXX and they informed me that Citizens never sent them the title and, in turn, lost my title. It's been over a year since I refinanced my vehicle XX / XX / XXXX, this should have been taking care much earlier.\\nI called Citizens to find out why they never sent it and they informed me after reviewing the place and having to request to speak with a manager several times that they had sent it by mail, but to the wrong address, which caused it to be lost. . I've been going back and forth with Citizens to send a warranty statement to XXXX. My credit union received the Release of Lien last Friday, XXXX XXXX, however, it was not signed, leaving it null and void. XXXX called Citizens indicating that it received the release of lean in unsigned and was informed by Citizens that it would be forwarded that day in a hurry, which should have been received no later than Tuesday or Wednesday of what Citizens stated.\\nThe citizens could not simply XXXX, but they sent it through the regular XXXX Mail. I never received it so again, I called Citizens to find out where it was. They stated that it was never sent by mail that XXXX XXXX wanted the title, which is incorrect. XXXX XXXX was aware that they had lost the title and specifically requested the release of the tax that Citizens had sent, however, it was not signed! The citizens informed me that it would be sent again and XXXX XXXX and should receive it before XXXX XXXX. I just received a call from XXXX so they do not receive it until Friday XXXX XXXX. This should have been received in the XX / XX / XXXX months. This has completely interrupted my entire life, has interrupted my employment to have to change my work schedule, so they were not happy just to be able to travel.\\nI had plans for the XXXX weekend with my daughters and I had to cancel them due to the incompetence of the Citizens bank. I had to reschedule appointments with the doctor and rely on everyone to help me get to the grocery store or anywhere I have to go. I had plans once more to go camping this weekend and again I had to cancel it because I did not know if it would really come this time.\\nHaving your vehicle is your independence and due to the incompetent behavior of Citizens bank, you have literally upset my whole being. I am extremely annoyed (anguished), it is not absolutely necessary for citizens to get away with it and to play with their lives in this way, since it is an extremely unprofessional financial institution. From the first moment of my call or XXXX, this should have accelerated, however, it was not. All this would not have happened if RBS had obtained the correct address when sending the title XX / XX / XXXX, therefore, it makes them responsible for my loss.\\n\"No amount of money will recover it for the loss that my family has had during this nightmare.\" ** I have a XXXX Declaration that I can send by email with more details of what happened.\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "Several months ago, XXXX ended its relationship with XXXX XXXX and transferred all accounts to Barclays. The transition was handled incredibly badly. I always paid my balance in full and supervised the online activity, but since all the records of my transactions disappeared from the XXXX web portal, I could not verify my balance and I did not agree with the balance that Barclays was showing and I do not think it was apply The last payment I made to XXXX XXXX. I have been talking on the phone with both companies several times in an effort to resolve this, but 3 months later I have not been able to do so. Meanwhile, I am not willing to pay Barclays the additional amount (more than {$ 1200.00}) that they believe I owe and that I believe was paid and that the account has accrued late fees and interest penalties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       "Tengo una cuenta de retiro de Wells Fargo de mi empleador por más de 9 años. Recientemente, en XXXX y XXXX, recibí correos electrónicos de XXXX de Wells Fargo. El primer correo electrónico tiene la línea de asunto \"¿Preguntas sobre su nueva cuenta? Programe una cita con un representante bancario, 'mi nombre' ''. El XXXX tiene la línea de asunto de\" Administre su hipoteca en línea ''. No abrí una nueva cuenta bancaria ni una hipoteca con Wells Fargo. Como puede imaginar, me sorprendió y me preocupó que mi información se usara de manera inadecuada para abrir nuevas cuentas con Wells Fargo. Después de que los llamé y pregunté al respecto, me dijeron que me habían colocado en estas cuentas, pero no pudieron eliminarme de ellas y que no era el titular principal de la cuenta. Dijeron que si quería saber más tendría que ir a una sucursal. Bueno, después de todas las noticias que salieron sobre Wells Fargo y las cuentas falsas, hoy fui a una sucursal. Ahora me dijeron que estas no son mis cuentas, sino más bien una persona que compartió la misma identidad y que envió un correo electrónico a su departamento de phishing, lo que es contrario a lo que me dijeron por primera vez por teléfono y que no creo que sea. El verdadero problema. Estoy realmente preocupado de que mi XXXX XXXX se esté utilizando para abrir cuentas falsas y no puedo hacer nada al respecto. ¡Por favor ayuda!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "Actualmente tengo un préstamo personal con One Main. Cuando abrí el préstamo, fue Springs Leaf. Tomé prestado {$ 5000.00} y nunca me perdí un pago en más de un año. La oficina principal de One me envió una oferta para pedir prestado {$ 4000.00}. Llamé para hacer una solicitud. Mi relación de endeudamiento de ingresos me permitió hacer el préstamo. Necesitaba hacer en el show {$ 700.00}. más en mis ingresos. Llamé de nuevo para preguntar si puedo aplicar con un cosignatario. Me dijeron que necesitaban vivir en la misma casa. Así que llamé a otra sucursal de OneMain y les dije lo que quería volver a solicitar con un cosignatario y le pregunté si el cosignatario necesitaba vivir en la misma casa. Me dijeron que no era necesariamente. La oficina de préstamos me mintió. Traté de abrir mi préstamo. Tengo cuenta allí ahora. Esta oficina se niega mi préstamo basado en una mentira. Debido a que no es necesario que el cosignatario viva en la misma casa coordinando a la segunda sucursal de OneMain a la que llamé.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",
       "Se llamó a la agencia de cobranza (Americollect) y se hicieron arreglos de pago. 50% ahora (regresó el XX / XX / XXXX en la primera llamada), 50% el próximo pago. La agencia de cobro acordó enviar la factura del saldo. El pago XX / XX / XXXX realizado por teléfono no se acreditó hasta el XX / XX / XXXX - 12 días para acreditarlo. No se ha enviado ni recibido ninguna factura de saldo (acordaron en una llamada grabada por ellos, que nunca enviaron la factura de saldo acordada). Ayer presentaron \"cobro / derogatorio\" en mis informes de crédito. Me enteré hoy cuando los llamé para pagar el saldo. ¡INJUSTO! El saldo ahora está totalmente pagado, la deuda está satisfecha.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",
       "XX / XX / 2015, Midland Credit Management was informed that it was represented by a lawyer and that they had not responded to a request to submit documents, including account statements, account numbers, payment history, proof that the account was mine. At that moment all communication ceased. However, during the last two months, you have violated my rights by starting to call our number XXXX and leave automated messages or hang up and call again several times. On XX / XX / 2015, they sent me a letter, in violation of the consumer protection laws, making reference to an account number, account XXXX, knowing that I had a lawyer. They still did not provide any documentation or proof that this account belonged to me. I have kept copies of your correspondence. Midland was sued by you for exactly this type of violation. Now they are trying this same tactic with me, in violation of my rights. I ask that you stop this collection activity immediately or I will file a complaint against them and any attorney who communicates with me against my rights, at the attorney general's office and will take appropriate legal action for this violation.

       "We have requested Citi Bank Mortgage at least 3 times to refinance our loan and withdraw money. Citibank asked us to close other accounts that we made, send it by fax document after document and then reject our request, but we would not give an explanation. They always send us a letter referring to one of the credit agencies.\\nOur mortgage has been with Citi for more than 10 years, but they can never give us the respect of an explanation or the reason for the denial. They would constantly call or send an email with their multiple demands for many forms and documents, but when it is time to listen to the results and the reason, it is always a voicemail. For me that's very disrespectful, I think this is discrimination and we have to address it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "Late payments are still reporting on all XXXX credit agencies. These should be reporting as late that my accounts were in postponement. I have contacted FedLoan several times, and also with the credit agencies, this needs to be updated since it is reporting very negative on my credit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "We have a second mortgage with Wells Fargo. Because the home equity lines are lower than the 8.99% we pay now, a caller from Wells Fargo suggested that we apply for a home equity line and settle the second mortgage. We made and asked for an additional {$ 11000.00} to do a job in our house. I got the strongest loan from Kentucky, which was honored 6 weeks ago. I received a call a moment ago and was told that Wells Fargo treats the Hardest Hit loans as if they were foreclosures and that is the reason why they rejected us. This is simply not correct. We obtained the most affected loan to avoid foreclosure and now we find that it is treated as a foreclosure even though it saved Wells Fargo XXXX dollars. If they had executed us in Wells Fargo, we would have lost the entire balance of their loan since they were holders of a second lien.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",

       "My mortgage loan from Wells Fargo \"Home Equity Loan\" was changed to another loan called \"Smart Fit Equity Line\" that we filed for bankruptcy 2 years ago. The home was not included in chapter XXXX of bankruptcy. Wells Fargo has blocked my account, so I can not make a payment. They say that due to bankruptcy.

They also increased my payment that I was going to pay, I have paid this amount XXXX times before without any problem, I have been doing it Difficulties but to achieve it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
       "Good afternoon CFPB: REQUEST TO LOCATE MY INVESTOR Case # XXXX I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The previous case number is related but it is not the reason why I am speaking today.\\nI've been trying to locate my investor for 2 years. My administrator BofA had repeatedly stated that they do not have access to that information. With the new ruling, we, as owners, have the right to know who owns our homes. Subsequent to this ruling, BofA sent me a letter indicating that the investor is Banco XXXX.\\n\\nI contacted XXXX and received your response that it is not the investors and that they are not the physical owners of the loan or my property. The letter goes on to say that BofA is the only direct contact regarding my application.\\n\\nSo a dead end. I spoke with my contact person in the BofA defense department today, his records show XXXX as an investor, and he expressed his opinion that when banks absorb other banks that access the information, they are buried and BofA may be the administrator and the investor\\n\\nThis seems deliberate and calculated to continue without having access to who owns my loan. I have a business plan that I have prepared to demonstrate the viability of paying my monthly mortgage obligation. Send your proposal to BYN by registered mail, with signature required. here there was no return of my business plan or the signature card, only the response email indicating that they are not investors.\\n\\nMY SALES DATE IS XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I will fax the documentation to which I have referred.\\n\\nI am happy to call your attention to this issue and I ask you to analyze this matter. I have very little time left and I hope that this sale date will be eliminated as the CFPB reviews my documents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "I have not received the results of the written investigation of any dispute with Equifax. The credit bureau has denied me access to credit monitoring. I can not access any of the online results of the investigations that have been completed. I have been denied credit in the last 90 days, therefore, I need an updated credit report to determine why this happened. XXXX rejected my credit card application based on the Equifax report and I need to know why.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "I was recently discussing with a representative of TCF and it was revealed that I paid more than {$ 1500.00} in fines since XXXX XXXX of 2015. I could not get any money back. This is excessive and the way they post transactions is predatory, forcing some items to overdraw and then collecting minor transactions that happen later. I would like to recover most (if not all) of my money.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "Experian Inc. is acting as a creditor, which is illegal.

At that time, we were dealing with XXXX XXXX, Escalation Specialist, until now, she will not answer our calls.\\nMeanwhile, also, the client has provided updated bank statements and payment receipts to PHH Mortgage, but refuses to notify us about the loan update because PHH marked the file as litigation. We were quick on numerous occasions to contact your lawyer, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and each time we were notified by your lawyer that you do not handle modifications, requests for documents or revision updates. We have confirmed in writing that the documentation was provided to PHH Mortgage and we confirmed that the client's file was still under review, that all documentation had been received and that someone would contact our office to update it. I found myself calling PHH Mortgage XXXX per week every week with the same shift!\\nAfter having demonstrated this to the Manager, the Specialists and the agent, they all backed down and rejected any responsibility for providing misleading information about the PHH mortgage review process, even though this is the essence of their work according to the guidelines of the Making Home Affordable program.\\nAs previously mentioned to all the agents who barely touched the file, the client's intention is to keep their home and return payments in good faith.\\nSince receiving the customer training application, PHH Mortgage has not performed the due diligence required by the client's file, and has caused undue stress to a client who has experienced enormous hardship, lives on a fixed income and is doing everything possible. to protect your home ... During all this time, all assigned participants could not communicate clearly about the evaluation and evaluation process. I cut myself off abruptly or they told me that there is a sale date in which the documents should have been reviewed.\\nNow ask PHH Mortgage to stop the sale date, carefully review the XXXX XXXX file and review it to see the exercise options that include HAMP, internal modifications and tolerance. PHH Mortgage is also requested to censor all parties for not performing adequately as a representative of the borrower.     1\n",
