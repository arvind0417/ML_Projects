       "Equifax mishandled my information, which has led to a violation that puts me and millions of others at a potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with the way in which Equifax has handled the notification of this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for almost a month after the violation was detected. I did not receive any email, letter or phone call and, instead, I had to discover it through social networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           13\n",

I have not been given a contract or any instrument with my signature that validates that this debt is mine.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   4\n",
       "I am filing this complaint because Equifax has ignored my request to provide me with the documents your company has on file that were used to verify the accounts I disputed.

       "A few months ago I applied for my credit report to Experian. I received this letter from them telling me that they received something that looked like fraud. I did not have the opportunity to call them immediately and, honestly, I thought it was a mistake, so I connected and got my report from some website.\\nI ended up filing some disputes because there was incorrect and incomplete information on my credit report. So I prepared a good letter and sent it with a copy of my driver's license, proof of my social security number and proof of my email address so that Experian can verify my identity.\\nIt has been at least 2 months since I sent my letter and I have not received a response. When I try to call their number XXXX, they want a report number before talking to an agent and, since I do not have one, I can not talk to anyone.\\nI thought that the credit companies had to answer me within 30 days, otherwise, are you supposed to eliminate things from my credit report?\\nWell, it's been more than 30 days and all the things I've discussed are still there. I know I can connect online, buy a credit monitoring service and try to dispute things online, but I thought Experian should help me for free!\\nI'm at the point where I've finished wasting my time and I need to fix it right away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3\n",
       "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. Months have passed and I still have not received an answer to my concerns. The only thing I have received is an automatic rejection letter stating that they did not do anything to help me (see the attached document).\\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I've already wasted a lot of time trying to get Experian to see the errors on my credit report and I'm so frustrated that Experian is not responding to my questions intentionally. I need to have this problem solved immediately. There are many things that I have to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I can not advance everything because of this credit agency!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3\n",

Whenever I request that inaccurate reports be corrected, XXXX posts an observation of \"Disputed resolved, the Client does not agree\". Nothing has been resolved. It was in postponement, so the final notices must be deleted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3\n",
       "Equifax a mal géré mes informations, ce qui a entraîné une violation qui met moi-même et des millions d'autres en danger Je suis extrêmement déçu de la manière dont equifax a géré le signalement de cette violation. Très peu de choses ont été faites pour informer le public pendant près d'un mois après la détection de la violation.

       "I have been a victim of identity theft. I have tried to work with the Credit Reporting Agency, but they refuse to honor my valid identity theft case, so these incorrect / fraudulent items are still on my credit report and should be removed immediately, but they do not belong to me. I have provided all the evidence to prove that I was a victim of identity theft and that, to my knowledge, these fraudulent accounts do not belong to me. Take immediate action on my behalf to be able to eliminate, delete and permanently block these elements of my credit report, so that I can return to normal.\\n\\nregards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3\n",

I contacted each company and was informed that there was no account opened under my information. I explained that I have a difficult question on my credit report and that I need to be removed as soon as possible in order to apply for housing. They told me that the queries would be deleted from my credit report. As of XXXX / XXXX / XXXX, none of the queries has been deleted since XXXX. I received an initial fraud alert on my XXXX XXXX report, so if the company contacted me with a credit report, the company would contact me before a decision was made. I just want the queries to be deleted so that my score and credit will no longer be affected. I would like to buy a house, but until all inquiries are eliminated, I will not be approved with XXXX queries on my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3\n",
       "A la edad de XXXX, se me otorgó un préstamo de automóvil malo para más del 21% en un vehículo que tenía 6 años. Mis pagos mensuales fueron {$ 300.00} por mes para el vehículo.

I request that you send me a copy of my signed authorization form that gave you the right to see my credit within five (5) business days so that I can verify its validity and informed you that if you can not provide proof that I authorized you to see my credit report, then I demand that they contact the credit agencies and ask them to eliminate the unauthorized and fraudulent consultation immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              2\n",

       "I am in an immaculate position with my HAMP modification. I have been sick for many years. The moment I realized that XXXX XXXX had caused my HAMP modification to be in ruins, I did not know what to do. Between XX / XX / XXXX-XX / XX / XXXX my ASC Loan Activity shows that the modification had a very poor start. My three (3) coupon payments for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX were placed on hold. My XXXX XXXX, was a payment reversal that returned to my checking account. The general rule is that I have been behind on my ASC mortgage statement for months, I have paid off my personal bank account payments, some missing mortgage payments, which are not easy to find, but I do in ASC Loan Activity and the reversals of payments. in my bank statements, and shows that the payment was canceled in my impressions of bank statements. But XXXX, all mortgage payments show that they are paid into the ASC database. Thus, this same type of activity was developed year after year. The last sums of money come through my bank account. In the bank printing XXXX / XXXX / XXXX. The grand total paid for 8 mortgage payments was {$ 19000.00}. That's 8 x {$ 610.00}. Other total XXXX totals of {$ 7300.00}, {$ 4900.00} and {$ 13000.00}. I spoke with the bank manager and she said that the transactions were more than 30 days old. But, these transactions continued until XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Some XXXX days after the trip to the bank, I received a letter from the Senior Vice President of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage XXXX XXXX XXXX, who said that my account was moving to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I received a letter from this same man a couple of weeks ago. He wrote to me and told me that the money from a check he had sent me \"may be subject to taxes.\" What check? I have no idea what he is talking about. From the XXXX to the present, I am inundated with letters from the ASC. The usual thing is the payment or the foreclosure is as follows. I receive a phone call, a free phone call. All day they harass me. My credit is destroyed. My social security number no longer matches my mortgage loan, my electricity bill. The Social Security Administration told me that the routing number in my checking account is now different from the one I gave them some time ago. I can not find my writing online or in the center office. I have isolated myself because the United States The Service Company is everything I can deal with all day long. I have to turn off my phone to get peace. That means I miss appointments with doctors, I never talk to my children, grandchildren, family and friends. I have not had a good night's sleep worried about my sliding somewhere so I can hear you can take my house. I'm always nervous and nervous. I feel like a child being harassed by a group of other children, and finally hopeless XXXX. Now they are sending me to XXXX for the final act and, hopefully, the victory of putting me on the street. In XXXX, ASC told XXXX XXXX that I had left my home and that my homeowner's insurance was canceled. ASC stated that I was months behind on my mortgage. I found a holiday sign on the door of my house. I eat at the hospital at that time. I want to recover my house, my life, my credit, my happiness, my friends and my family. XXXX XXXX is the executive mortgage specialist in Wells Fargo, NA. From XX / XX / XXXX to the present, she and her conservationist subordinates, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, have constantly worked to destroy my HAMP Loan.

       "Because there is talk of an increase in rates, I decided to review the prices of a XXXX posted on the Provident Fundings (PF) website XXXX. PF offers a price tool on the website that shows the current prices they offer with certain assumed criteria. If the criteria were not met, I knew that the adjustments could change, but the base price would be the same. The XXXX price shown on the website at 2.875% for 15 fixed years would have covered all closing costs with any remaining credit applied to the prepaid items. Those were my desired terms and why I chose to send the application with PF the XXXX, existing ARM refi to the fixed maintenance index in XXXX and the prices would cover all closing costs. I completed the application online with my borrower's information, revealing income assets, etc. PF did not inform until after completing all the fields of the application that a XXXX would not contact me until 24 hours after the presentation to complete the application process (extract credit and execute the AU engine) that delays the blocking capacity. PF provides contact information for the MCs on the website along with the general inquiry number. After sending the application and worrying about market volatility, I called the general inquiry number and asked to speak with XXXX available to complete the application process. The representative with whom I spoke rejected my request to speak with a XXXX and informed me that I had to wait 48 hours to speak with an MC to complete the application. I also addressed the concern about the volatility of the market and stated that if they contacted me after 48 hours if the price was not the same or PF would not meet the desired price of XXXX, I would not move forward at that time. The decision to delay the application in XXXX was not made by me, it was made by PF. PF decided to delay the remaining application process, by denying the request to speak with MC PF made me subject to market volatility. When I was finally contacted by XXXX in XXXX my concerns were confirmed. In those XXXX hours between XXXX and XXXX, the credit offered for the XXXX rate decreased by .375%, which, depending on the loan amount requested, the difference was {$ 720.00}. I addressed my concern with XXXX and asked PF to respect the XXXX prices due to the fact that I completed the application on my final and asked to speak with MC to complete the application process on XXXX, which was denied. I told XXXX that this was unfair and that it was my decision in XXXX not to go ahead at this time, unless they complied with XXXX prices or until prices were back in XXXX, which is not a guarantee of what it would. It was unfair because the delay caused by the FP cost me $ 720.00. I received an email from XXXX after our call confirmed my concern, stated in an email that, according to current XXXX PF prices, I could offer a 15-year service set to XXXX with {$ 650.00} in closing costs. Based on the quote, if you take into account the difference in XXXX XXXX {$ 720.00} prices if PF granted my request to complete the application with XXXX and allowed me to block, I would not have paid the closing costs and the remaining credit of {$ 74.00} applied. Prepaid items This is an unfair practice on the part of PF to make the prices available online, which encourages consumers to send an application, but it makes them wait 48 hours to speak with XXXX to complete the application due to the delay of PF and not allowing a consumer to speak with an MC Request to complete the application and block the loan on the same day. It is unfair to make a consumer subject to market volatility due to PF delays and pass these costs on to the customer. During a conversation with another representative, he agreed that an application could be completed in a matter of minutes if the request was granted. He stated that the current business model of PF requires consumers to wait 48 hours to be contacted by an MC to complete the application and that a consumer could not request to speak with a XXXX before. Consumers like me present an application to refinance based on the prices that PF is showing on the website and, later, they will not be contacted until after 48 hours. Meanwhile, they are subject to market volatility and can not talk to XXXX before completing the on-demand process. to obtain approval and blocking at the desired available price.     1\n",
       "For your information, there is not much selection for the specific topic of this poorly represented subject, therefore, I opted for the best selection when selecting that there should be no response to the demand.\\n\\nI settled a debt XXXX / XXXX / 2014. The agreement in the full letter provided is not enough according to the credit agencies. The credit bureaus will not recognize the letter because the debt collector is a third party representing a third party and the letter lists the original creditor, as well as the full original account number. I told the collection agency, Praxis Financial Services, that the credit bureaus are not accepting your letter. The consistent response from PFS was that we never had this problem and we sent letters all the time and there is no problem with updating the credit bureaus. I'm having a problem and nobody wants to help. Do not tell consumers that a letter that shows that the debt has been resolved will suffice. Very deceitful and it is a violation of the fdcpa. If I tell this business that the letter does not work, they should make an effort to solve the problem, such as contacting the buyer of the debt, who will not answer the phone, to solve the problem. I also tried to contact the original creditor and I could not get any confirmation that this debt was in a place with this agency and the fact that the praxis is not willing to contact the agencies or help rectify the problem is a warning signal .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

Tengo un recibo del saldo completo / XXXX del XXXX XXXX XXXX con Omni Financial XXXX como acreedor original para justificar mi reclamo.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "My uncle had a house is XXXX Washington. The moneylenders continued to suck to refinance it in cash and continued to try to do so even after they informed him that he had XXXX. I am a real estate agent and I quickly ran comps. I was face down during the time they were still trying to withdraw refinancing. The house was worth around XXXX and he owed it XXXX. I cleaned the house so he could go home to live his last days and I cleaned it more after his death. I live in Alaska and this involved several trips and time away from my business to do it. The bank then tried to get a default ruling on me, although I never lived in the house, never signed in your bank account, and never on your mortgage, and I lived more than 20 miles away! I had to spend thousands of dollars defending myself from this legal action. My husband and I were in the process of building a house here, and this would have ruined our funding! Even though a court order dismissed me from the case, the bank is still trying to charge me. My uncle approved XX / XX / XXXX and I will present this complaint on XX / XX / XXXX.

Paypal a déclaré que rien ne changerait, ils auraient encore besoin de garder l'argent pendant 90 à 180 jours.\\nS'IL VOUS PLAÎT S'IL VOUS PLAÎT S'IL VOUS PLAÎT AIDE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "Knowing that I would become a delinquent in my Sallie Mae Private Student Loans, I tried to communicate with the consumer representative to be proactive and see what could be done. I asked to speak with a collection agent, and they did not let me through because my account was not due. Instead, the representative told me that he talked to them and they (Collections) said they could not help me until my account was overdue, so I should leave it expired if I wanted help. He told me that he was 5 days late, and that after 15 days of delay, but that I would not have to worry since 30 days is when they inform me to the Credit Office. This is extremely annoying. Do you want me to lose a payment before they help me? How is that useful? It puts a stain on my account. Also, who can say that they can even help me after I lose the payment? This is a situation where I needed to know if someone could help me or if I should start calling all my family and friends to see if anyone could help me make my payment. I needed help today, not when I'm beaten. This has really bothered me, since I feel they are giving bad advice and lack customer service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           1\n",
       "XXXX XXXX XXXX\\nXXXX rapporte 4 comptes de délinquants. Il n'y a que 2 comptes. Un montant de XXXX $ et un autre XXXX $. Le compte avec un solde de XXXX $ a été payé en retard par l’assurance et a été supprimé du rapport XXXX XXXX mais toujours sur XXXX. J'ai envoyé en contestation. La société a dupliqué les deux comptes dans tous les rapports de crédit, ce qui donne à penser qu'il y a 4 comptes en souffrance alors qu'il ne s'agit que de 2 comptes et que, comme indiqué ci-dessus, l'un a été payé en retard par l'assurance. Ce faisant, il a doublé le nombre d'éléments désagréables dans les rapports de crédit. Ce sont aussi des factures médicales qui ne sont pas déclarées comme médicales, mais plutôt comme des comptes de prêt ordinaires, ce qu'elles ne sont pas. SYSTÈMES DE DONNÉES MÉDICALES INC.

       "I recently filed a complaint with the CFPB about my federal student loan form. I asked for a 40% reduction in my student loans because my school was closed due to false advertising and other laws that were broken for the school for profit XXXX XXXX. I submitted the CFPB response to Navient along with the school loan application and I was denied because I graduated from school. Even though I graduated, I still do not get the XXXX payment that Navient is asking me to pay monthly or the other loans I had to take while attending this school. It was more than XXXX XXXX returned for the students who were affected and I was one of the many students affected by the XXXX scam and I feel that I am entitled to my 40% reduction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "In XXXX XXXX I requested a modification of my mortgage, XXXX / XXXX / XXXX sent me a package with a payment plan for 3 months. At XXXX / XXXX / XXXX I was informed that I had successfully completed the trial period and that the details of my new payment plan were sent to me showing me a principal and interest of {$ 1100.00} and an amount under guarantee of { $ 500.00} for a total of $ {$ 1600.00} with an interest rate of 3.75%. XXXX / XXXX / XXXX I received a statement with a payment of {$ 1700.00} showing an interest rate of 4.375% and a capital of {$ 750.00} and interest of {$ 910.00} and a security deposit of {$ 65.00 } Then, at XXXX / XXXX / XXXX I received a principal payment of {$ 760.00} interest of {$ 910.00} and security deposit of {$ 65.00} even with an interest rate of 4.375%. Now I am receiving a payment request for {$ 2200.00}.\\nI do not understand why the change in the amounts and the interest rate Initially I had a mortgage for approx. : {$ 2900.00} for 15 years, I could not make the payments on time after my divorce and request the modification, but it seems that now more than 30 years want me to pay {$ 2200.00} monthly and still have the subordinated mortgage of {$ 77000.00} to pay. I have tried many times to remove the deposit and allow me to pay for it myself, since I had never been late or missed anything before the modification, but it seems that I do not care and the only response I received from Ocwen was that \"if I can not pay the mortgage and then sell the house.

       "XXXX. Originally I told them that I would pay for all the services when they were finished. The procedures were incomplete at the end of the day and they sent me hastily to enroll me in a financial company, Care Credit (Synchrony Bank), to pay for the work. I was still disoriented from the procedures and was surprised that it was not finished. I did not know I was creating any additional work that would be charged to this credit account. I received the invoice a few weeks later and it was for an excess of {$ 4200.00}. None of the jobs for which I was charged was performed, except XXXX XXXX, which were not even completed and were not performed correctly. I had to do the work again in another XXXX. I disputed the charges with Care Credit (Synchrony Bank) and they completed an investigation that resulted in a judgment in my favor and that was withdrawn from the bill {$ 800.00}. They claimed that I still owed more than {$ 3400.00} per XXXX failed XXXX. Although I can prove with XXXX that I never received XXXX for what they charged me, they told me that they have taken the word from the dentist that these services were provided and support their charges. I will be in contact with a lawyer, but I want to report what I believe has been the fraudulent billing of this XXXX, the charge for services that were never made and the support of this fraud on behalf of Care Credit (Synchrony Bank).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "The bank Chase withdrew {$ 1800.00} XXXX / XXXX / 2016 without permission and has been turning me around to get it back. The problem is derived from a cashier's check that was made in my account and returned later; however, as they decided to simply withdraw the money, I am now at a distance of XXXX miles away from my house, with an excess bank account and bills to be paid. They have no legal right to my money and have no reason to act so slowly. It should be borne in mind that the employees of the branch were very helpful and tried harder to help me with this problem, but they still could not solve it. They were told they had to solve the problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        1\n",

       "Terminé mi servicio con XXXX en XXXX 2015 debido a la insatisfacción con su facturación. Me vendieron un receptor digital y ofrecieron un reembolso cuando se devolvió el receptor analógico que se está reemplazando. Nunca recibió la caja para devolver el receptor antiguo, y cuando fueron llamados, negaron haber aceptado el reembolso. Yo había acordado verbalmente extender mi contrato por dos años. Así que cancelé mi servicio. Recibí una factura de \"tarifa de terminación\" de {$ 380.00}. Tenía conocimiento de los Estatutos 44-101 (5) del XXXX que establece que un acuerdo verbal que no se debe realizar dentro de un año no se puede cumplir. Como nunca firmé el acuerdo, Escribí a XXXX el XXXX XXXX, 2015, informándoles sobre el estatuto y la inaplicabilidad. Luego empecé a recibir llamadas de robo de Focus Receivable Management en XXXX (XXXX) pidiéndome que las llame. Recibí tres llamadas de empleados, y Me negué a hablar de mi negocio personal con una parte desconocida. Les dije que respondería a una carta escrita, pero no a una llamada telefónica. Todavía no he recibido una llamada telefónica, y solo creo que la ubicación de la empresa se basa en un Búsqueda XXXX. Me doy cuenta de que conforme a la ley federal (Ley de Prácticas Justas para el Cobro de Deudas) solo puedo detener las llamadas telefónicas mediante notificación por escrito, pero no tengo información de ubicación para enviar dicha carta. Por favor, ayúdenme a detener este hostigamiento.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "I contacted the credit bureau about the two debts that appear on my credit report that I am not aware of the accounts several times. Accounts XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX continue to appear on my credit report after having discussed them with the person by phone and online. Each time they return and they say that the debt is valid and verified without showing the proper proof. When I call and speak with a representative, the representatives tell me to contact the creditors and ask them to eliminate the debt. I always had the impression that we should not contact the original creditor because it violates the FCRA because they ask me to contact the original creditor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       "XXXX XXXX, 2011 the law was filed and our house evicted us due to a foreclosure, together with my children a week before XXXX. We had fought with the Bank of America for 1.5 years, trying to resolve when my husband and I lost our home, we even had a reward that Bank of America rejected, because the mortgage was canceled and the sale of my house was for profit only for the bank of america We were told that we would receive the paperwork we needed to sign and return, so we kept our house in two weeks, they came and went without paperwork, we called again in two weeks, this went on and on. Needless to say, we lost the house in which I grew up and my children grew up in a house for which I had paid XXXX mortgages. Bank of America not only forced us to take out insurance that increased my payment from {$ 640.00} to {$ 1100.00} per month, but they lied to us and called us XXXX or more times a day or their machines called us. We went to the debt advisers who asked us and told us we could keep our home if we followed the instructions that we made in vain. Then, in the agreement we got a grand total of around {$ 800.00}, which was nothing more than an insult. We moved to a house that, for all rights, should have been condemned, we stayed there while we could raise the money to move, now we live in a place that, in the best of cases, is barely standing, I have a family old woman (father) I have to be close to I hope that anyone who reads this never uses Bank of America, my husband and I work and do not receive government assistance in any way. However, we have lost everything, there was nothing now or to help us recover anything that we lost, our bank in America stripped our credit of our house while they gave bonds of one million dollars with the money that I work and payment in taxes. However, no one was there to rescue my family. I know that only in my area there were several who went through the same problems as my family. So much for the American dream!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          1\n",
       "Today I received an email from them that said they were filing charges against me for check fraud for a bad loan I have with them.

       "For a year I was called on a debt for delaware solutions, but they do not reveal the debt, they just call it \"check against fraud\". Sometimes it is the XXXX or XXXX companies that request the same debt in the same month, they say they are legal. Dept but it will be specific. They keep calling my workplace, although I have been asked not to do it myself and the others in the office, I will lose my job. They called my office XXXX on XXXX / XXXX / 14. They use theft calls and threaten jail and fines. I've talked to these debt collectors and asked them to send me all the information about the original debt, including my signature that says I accepted the contract, then they get angry and start yelling. they refuse to give them my personal information but they continue the call, they think that because they have the last XXXX digits of my SS number, I will accept to pay them money, they threaten the jail time and the fines if I do not pay with them. A few days, After rejecting the calls, I stop for a week or XXXX and I start again. I have blocked them from my personal phone, but they still call my work, they even call the phone number of my brothers' house. I did not even have that number. How they got it I do not know. I just want this to end a year after this harassment is more than everyone should have to endure. The lawyers say they can not do anything because these companies change their location. One would think that after a year they would know that I will not give them anything and I will move on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
       "We are in the third month of the mortgage loan process without an end in sight. We are buying a house and the seller will not extend the contract after XX / XX / 2016. We have responded quickly to any documentation that the lender needs and we are still waiting for loan approval and loan documents.

Entity XXXX, XXXX never responded to my complaint that I made to my XXXX from NJ and EXPERIAN continues to report that the item falsely damaged my creditworthiness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     1\n",
