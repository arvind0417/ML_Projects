       "Equifax mishandled my information, which has led to a violation that puts me and millions of others at a potential risk. I am extremely disappointed with the way in which Equifax has handled the notification of this breach. Very little was done to notify the public for almost a month after the violation was detected. I did not receive any email, letter or phone call and, instead, I had to discover it through social networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           13\n",

Since they have passed the 30-day mark and can not verify these accounts, under Section 611 (5) (A) of the FCRA, they are required to \"... quickly remove all information that can not be verified\" I have disputed .

Je n'ai reçu aucun courrier électronique, lettre ou appel téléphonique, mais j'ai dû le découvrir via les médias sociaux.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   3\n",

       "I have been a victim of identity theft. I have tried to work with the Credit Reporting Agency, but they refuse to honor my valid identity theft case, so these incorrect / fraudulent items are still on my credit report and should be removed immediately, but they do not belong to me. I have provided all the evidence to prove that I was a victim of identity theft and that, to my knowledge, these fraudulent accounts do not belong to me. Take immediate action on my behalf to be able to eliminate, delete and permanently block these elements of my credit report, so that I can return to normal.\\n\\nregards                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3\n",

       "While reviewing my personal credit report, I noticed an unauthorized and fraudulent credit request made by XXXX on or around XX / XX / XXXX in Transunion. I did not authorize any person employed by this company to make any inquiries and see my credit report. XXXX has violated Law 1681b (c) of the Fair Credit Information Act.

My social security number is XXXX and my date of birth is XX / XX / XXXX in case it is necessary to locate the fraudulent query on your system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             3\n",

I contacted each company and was informed that there was no account opened under my information. I explained that I have a difficult question on my credit report and that I need to be removed as soon as possible in order to apply for housing. They told me that the queries would be deleted from my credit report. As of XXXX / XXXX / XXXX, none of the queries has been deleted since XXXX. I received an initial fraud alert on my XXXX XXXX report, so if the company contacted me with a credit report, the company would contact me before a decision was made. I just want the queries to be deleted so that my score and credit will no longer be affected. I would like to buy a house, but until all inquiries are eliminated, I will not be approved with XXXX queries on my credit report.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3\n",
       "A few months ago I applied for my credit report to Experian. I received this letter from them telling me that they received something that looked like fraud. I did not have the opportunity to call them immediately and, honestly, I thought it was a mistake, so I connected and got my report from some website.\\nI ended up filing some disputes because there was incorrect and incomplete information on my credit report. So I prepared a good letter and sent it with a copy of my driver's license, proof of my social security number and proof of my email address so that Experian can verify my identity.\\nIt has been at least 2 months since I sent my letter and I have not received a response. When I try to call their number XXXX, they want a report number before talking to an agent and, since I do not have one, I can not talk to anyone.\\nI thought that the credit companies had to answer me within 30 days, otherwise, are you supposed to eliminate things from my credit report?\\nWell, it's been more than 30 days and all the things I've discussed are still there. I know I can connect online, buy a credit monitoring service and try to dispute things online, but I thought Experian should help me for free!\\nI'm at the point where I've finished wasting my time and I need to fix it right away.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           3\n",
       "Three times I have sent requests to individual credit agencies XXXX as well as to XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting the inaccurate report of late payments in XXXX and XXXX XXXX to be removed from all XXXX of my federal loans with account numbers XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, & XXXX.

       "I have sent several requests to Experian requesting an investigation of my accounts. Months have passed and I still have not received an answer to my concerns. The only thing I have received is an automatic rejection letter stating that they did not do anything to help me (see the attached document).\\nThis has to be a violation of my rights. I feel like I've already wasted a lot of time trying to get Experian to see the errors on my credit report and I'm so frustrated that Experian is not responding to my questions intentionally. I need to have this problem solved immediately. There are many things that I have to do with my life and they all involve my credit. But I can not advance everything because of this credit agency!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            3\n",

Il lui a dit qu'il recherchait un taux fixe, aucune assurance PMI, que les frais de clôture étaient inclus dans le prêt et estimait que notre maison pourrait être évaluée à {250000,00}, comme elle l'était à l'origine lorsque nous l'avons construite, y compris 33 acres de terrain. Nous avons fourni toutes nos informations financières (pensions, économies et biens supplémentaires à notre domicile). Le représentant a confirmé que nous avions un excellent crédit. A reçu une estimation de prêt sur XXXX avec des frais de clôture de {7700,00 $} et {1000,00} CASH dus à la date de clôture. Remarquez, on m'a dit que je n'avais qu'à payer {500,00 $} pour lancer le processus, le reste pouvait être calculé sur le prêt. L’évaluateur est ensuite venu chez nous. Au XXXX, l’évaluation a été effectuée pour {210000,00} $ et les maisons comparées se trouvaient à plus de 11 miles et se situaient entre 7 et 28 ans, ce qui a porté nos coûts de clôture à {11000,00} avec {3200,00} CASH dus au moment de la clôture. . Quand j'ai appelé et interrogé l'évaluation, on m'a dit qu'ils ne pouvaient pas contester l'évaluation. Je leur ai dit que je ne voulais plus poursuivre ce prêt. J'ai téléphoné au bureau exécutif chargé de ces questions et j'ai parlé avec lui. On m'a dit que nous pouvions fournir à l'évaluateur les ventes de notre choix. Je viens de payer l'évaluation, pourquoi dois-je fournir les informations? Le processus de Quicken Loan est un excellent moyen de vérifier le crédit des particuliers et de leurs avoirs, ainsi que d’augmenter les prêts et les paiements pour obtenir plus d’argent. L'évaluation aurait dû être une meilleure comparaison dans un rayon plus proche et des aspects similaires de notre maison. Lorsque nous avons construit notre maison il y a trois ans, les taux étaient plus bas et il s'agissait d'un marché pour les acheteurs. Aujourd'hui, les taux sont en hausse et il s’agit d’un marché de vendeurs ... ne devrait-il pas être plus élevé que l’évaluation initiale? Notre maison ne devrait pas avoir perdu de valeur !!!! J'ai demandé au représentant de QL de manière hypothétique si nous avions reçu le prêt, si nous avions fait défaut et si nous avions pris possession de la maison, incluraient-ils les planchers de bois franc et de porcelaine, les comptoirs à surface solide, le système de chaudière sur demande, le chauffage au sol par rayonnement, les appuis de fenêtre en corian, les armoires à médaillons , terrasse en composite, fenêtres à triple vitrage, 33 acres, etc. J'ai demandé le remboursement de l'évaluation de {450,00 $}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "I opened a Stash Rewards credit card and set up my account online. I made some purchases and then XXXX large purchases of around {$ 2200.00} that were rejected and triggered a fraud alert on my account. I called Synchrony Bank to ask why the transaction was declined and was told that I had to send them an ID verification in order to withdraw my account retention. They said it had to be sent by mail and not by email. I mailed the items you requested. Two weeks later, I called them to find out the status and they told me that they had received my identification documents and that they still had to check them. She said she will inform me of her decision in 7-10 days. Three weeks have passed without a word from them. Today I received an email indicating that my payment is due and that I must log in to my account to make a payment. I tried to do that, but I'm still blocked from my account.\\n\\nI sent the documents they requested and I still do not have access to my line of credit or the ability to make a payment.

       "The company keeps calling me and leaving me messages. When I answer it's just a recording of a very nonspecific nature trying to call them. I have excellent credit and nothing outstanding on my credit report, so I know they are not trying to charge me a debt. At this point I feel it is harassment. Several calls a day are too many and answering them does nothing because there is nobody to talk to just a recording. I will not call a number and I will have to pay international fees like so many other scams. I need you to remove me from your call list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "Equifax did not adequately secure my personal information protected against intrusions, such as through appropriate patches, 2-factor authentication at the point of service, data segmentation, etc. As such, my full name, Social Security numbers, date of birth, addresses and possibly the driver's license number are compared to each other and are in the hands of criminals who can use this data to violate any number of accounts in perpetuity, such as my bank and financial data, medical data, legal claims, political data, and any other number of sensitive accounts.\\nAlso, I can not secure these accounts because they request very personal information that is violated to verify my identity and approve a change.\\nCurrently, Equifax offers a limited credit monitoring service, which is not even activated immediately. Even this should be searched by those who see the news reports, follow the news links to the Equifax page, which in turn links to a third party website that requests two thirds of the social security number plus the last name and one renounce all class action resources to discover if one of the violated accounts was only modified to renounce the class action resource of the third party site if the confidential information that is consulted once the news is published is also violated of this diffusion.

       "RTR states that I owe them XXXX on a second mortgage, but the date of the first delinquency is XX / XX / XXXX, which is beyond the 5 year SOL of Illinois. They are also reporting this information to XXXX, which includes a backlog every month for the past 6 years, a past due balance and the current amount owed. This particular loan was secured by a property that was executed by XXXX XXXX. RTR was never included among the claimants (as was XXXX). This foreclosure occurred in XX / XX / XXXX. RTR has NEVER verified any document that indicates how, why or where they have a valid claim for a second mortgage. They were not in any court documents provided by the county and the plaintiffs.

       "Wells Fargo is scamming clients with available balance discrepancies (holding money). Then I collect the fees for \"overdraft protection transfer\". At XXXX I noticed that I had a low balance in my current account that would not be enough to cover my pending transactions. I changed everything that was visible to me in XXXX in my savings account back to my checking account t ({$ 4.00}). This raised my balance to cover all pending transactions. That night, Wells Fargo took the money from my checking account and sent it to my savings for transfers \"Save as you go\" For weekend transactions. This money was withheld and was not visible for my transfer with {$ 4.00} in the XXXX. I was not aware that these transfers as they were kept were even pending. Because they moved (published) this money at the last minute of the XXXX night later, this caused my current account to fall below the amount necessary to cover the pending transactions. Wells Fargo then charged me a fee of {$ 12.00} to return the money from my savings to my checking account to cover the pending transactions.\\nSo Wells Fargo made transactions from my savings, moved the money on the night of the XXXX when I already had a low balance in my checking account, which caused the balance to fall below what is necessary to cover the pending transactions. Then they charged a fee to return the money to my checking account that ONLY moved into my savings the same night. If Wells Fargo had left the money in my checking account instead of transferring it to my savings, the balance would have been enough to cover the pending transactions and I would not have been charged an overdraft protection transfer fee.\\nWells Fargo should have some type of \"checks and balances\" in its programming that prevents its systems from moving money to savings accounts when the balance in the checking account is sufficient to cover the pending transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",
       "XXXX / XXXX / 16 I used the electronic \"Payment of invoices\" of my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, to configure the payment of my credit card to the Bank of America, that expired XXXX / XXXX / 16. The expiration date , XX. / XX / XXXX, it was Sunday and my bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX had XXXX and XXXX blocked. I could not establish a payment for XXXX / XXXX / 16. Therefore, I scheduled it for Monday XXXX / XXXX / 16. The Bank of America received payment on XXXX / XXXX / 16. However, XX / XX / XXXX charged me a surcharge of $ 25.00} and interest of $ 6.00 for a total of {$ 31.00} in fees. I did not realize that they had charged the rates in question until Friday XXXX / XXXX / 16 because I was very, very busy in the previous months and did not have time to reconcile my account. My routine, in order to avoid surcharges and / or late interest, after receiving the invoice from the BOA, go to my bank's website and set the payment to be paid on the due date for the amount of the balance of the state of account.\\nXXXX / XXXX / 16 I called BOA and was told that they could not reverse the rates because they had made a XX / XX / XXXX courtesy reversal for a payment that had been delayed by 1 day due to something of the XXXX that occurred in which the payment was not made. I'm glad I checked my account online the next day and I realized that the payment had not been made. I acted immediately and BOA reversed the late charge and interest. BOA states that they can only make the XXXX courtesy adjustment within one year. My problem is that this should not be treated as a courtesy adjustment; my account must be accredited by the amount of the fees by a superior person who has the authority to do so. I feel that the payment they received on Monday, XXXX / XXXX / 16, was a timely payment, since Sunday is not a legal banking day AND I COULD NOT ESTABLISH THE PAYMENT USING ONE DATE SUNDAY ON MY BANK, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX THE SITE WEB OF \"PAYMENT OF INVOICES\", WHICH IS HOW I PAY ALL MY BILLS. SUNDAY WAS BLOCKED. The rule I remember about the payments was that the Monday following Sunday's due date was considered appropriate. I called them on Sunday, the due date, and even if they had not received the funds until Monday, the payment would have been considered appropriate. For XXXX, I'm not used to making payments by phone. I had to provide the account number and route number in addition to other information I do not want to provide over the phone. And on the other hand, I did not know what would make a difference; I thought that the payment would be considered opportune that Monday.\\nIronically, I closed this account a month earlier and I was able to see this charge and interest arrears before the final payment, which expires XXXX / XXXX / 16. I had the payment scheduled on my bank's website for XX / XX / XXXX, since XX / XX / XXXX is Sunday again. Of course, now that I know I can make the payment by phone on the due date, I will cancel the payment online, since I certainly do not want to face a repeat of this nightmare.\\nI am a low income person and these rates will really hurt if they are not reversed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

       "I had a Toyota Corolla leased with Toyota Motor Credit Corporation. The vehicle was returned on XXXX / XXXX / 2015 and I drive a XXXX now, which I have with TMCC's employee leasing program. I received several phone calls from a debt collector called XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in my work and on my cell phone during work hours after asking the company to stop harassing me when they returned my vehicle and no debts were left. I have sent several documents that my husband and I drove a vehicle through TMCC and we paid for it, and they told me that if I changed one Toyota car for another, no fee would be charged. Once all my information was sent and the calls stopped. Months later, I received another call from a different agency. I have never received any response or letters in months since XX / XX / XXXX. I received a call for payment XX / XX / XXXX on this debt once again, after sending information and giving proof that I was a driver of a Lexus, along with a copy of my driver's license and my husband's and mine's and the new vehicle contract. You should not be receiving phone calls after asking for calls to stop and after trying.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "There are XXXX loans in question that were originally held by XXXX XXXX (a company that abused the system). The resulting split to avoid further scrutiny has meant that my loans are now with Navient (note that I had no other choice in this matter). Due to overwhelming charges and your total refusal to review a payment plan based on income, I have decided to return to school to finish my degree. During the last XXXX years, I have been taking enough courses to qualify for postponement in school as I work to progress in my career and finish school with an income capable of supporting these exorbitant fees. Navient now claims that I am late / XXXX months late in payments all the time I have been taking classes all the time. I spoke with a representative of the XXXX weeks about the situation. They asked me to fax the paperwork that showed that I was in the middle of the courses and that the matter would be resolved. I did what was requested. From that moment I did not receive phone calls. Shortly after I discovered that Navient had not made the right corrections, it was harassing my co-signer with more than XXXX automatic calls per day. This is unacceptable. I have tried ad nauseam to contact Navient but your phone system gets you in a loop. By crushing 'XXXX' enough times to talk to a representative, every time they say they can not hear it and disconnect the call. This company is predatory in every respect of the definition. They are rude, aggressive and threatening on the phone, but have no way of contacting them to correct their mistakes. They only worry about requesting money from whoever answers their calls. This is unacceptable and their behavior is overwhelming and frightening. We tell our young people that they can not succeed without advanced education. Then we charge them fees that do not correspond to the education provided, but we assure them that 'we' are there to help them through loans that will be easy to pay once they have that degree and a huge salary. Once the student becomes an adult to realize that everything that was promised was a lie, the phone rings ... this is unacceptable and, at least, we have to stop the predatory behavior of these lenders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             1\n",
       "SLS will not provide me with online account statements so I can see where the numerous fees attached to my mortgage payment apply. Initially they declared that it was because my mortgage was behind; However, since then I have reached it. My monthly payment continues to increase and, as I do not have access to the online documents, I feel that they are currently taking advantage of me.

The contractor (XXXX) told me he thought the insurance did not give me enough money so he could get more money because it was not enough for me to need about $ XXXX because of the new laws and restrictions, and he assured me that if he did not You can get me more money, build the building for the XXXX that I received from the insurance company. The contractor (XXXX XXXX) told me for that reason that I needed to contact my bank, explaining that it is the responsibility of the banks to take full advantage of the insurance company because they have my mortgage and have many lawyers to go after the company. insurance. The contractor also told me that he used to be an insurance adjuster and that he was SURE he would get me more money if he could only talk to my bank (of course, that was a lie). Then I trusted him thinking that this man knows what he is doing. So a few times I came to SPEAK WITH XXXX. I did not know they had all that money for 5 months or no money at all! So, my next question was \"was not my name on those checks?\" BOA answered \"yes, both my name and XXXX XXXX XXXX were in the checks.\" That means a 3-way call with (XXXX XXXX) the contractor and BOA. BOA would ask me if I would give them permission to talk to XXXX, of course I said yes. Before XXXX started talking to BOA, he told me he could hang up now, so I did. This happened a few times. In my mind, I am thinking that he is talking to you about the insurance company (as he told me he would do) and about how to get more money (from the insurance company) because XXXX was not enough. The communication of XXXX with me was great. Every time I called or wrote a text message, it gave me (what I thought) the updates about what is happening with the city that approves the project to build the building. Five months go by and he continues to tell me stories about why the city is taking so long to approve the project. Right now I'm thinking that the contractors want me to approve this as badly as I do so they can start and get their money. I decided to call the city anyway and beg them to speed up the project. In my surprise, when I called the city, they told me that they HAD NEVER LISTENED TO THIS COMPANY (XXXX XXXX XXXX)! WHAT?! So I called XXX to ask if the contractor was doing something on his part. XXX tells me that they issued the XXXX XXXX XXXX 2 CHECKS EQUAL TO XXXX SENT DIRECTLY TO YOUR ADDRESS 5 MONTHS AGO! XXX never sent me a single letter telling me that they sent these checks. I NEVER gave XXXX permission to give these contractors any checks, I ONLY gave permission to speak with the contractor. XXXX XXXX XXXX FORGED MY SIGNATURE and collected it at the bank Chase 5 months before I found out. I put a police report immediately in the XXXX police department with Detective XXXX XXXX. Later I discover that this same contractor was convicted of stealing $ XXXX ({$ 65000.00}) from another owner just a few months before doing this to me! The owner of Universal Consultant (XXXX XXXX) has many previous convictions, including another case for {$ 300,000.00} from another client. I contacted List XXXX where I found this contractor and XXXX XXXX told me that this contractor was expelled from XXXX XXXX because he received many complaints. A lot of complaints about taking money from the owners and not doing the work for them. I'm not the only victim that XXXX XXXX stole. They were many before me and many later!     1\n",

Home Depot should have done it months ago. I have never missed a payment in more than 41 years of having credit. NEVER. NO XXXX. Now my credit is destroyed. My FICO has fallen on the XXXX points. There is something very, very wrong with this situation.\\n\\nI thought this was an isolated incident and it was something specific for me. After some XXXX searches, I am discovering that there are many, many other Home Depot credit card holders that have found evidence very similar to mine.\\n\\nI want this to be removed from my credit rating. If they had sent me a statement as if they were supposed to do this, it would never have happened. They did not make a good faith effort to let me know that the account was going to be overdue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
       "Procollect.Inc m'a contacté il y a deux ans pour recouvrer la dette que je ne devais pas.

       "I am surprised that the CITI bank can send me a ton of pages from previous years, but I can not comply with a request to provide me with an IP address or something that I signed and that indicates that this card is mine. My identity was stolen and I am just trying to find out what debts are mine and would make payment arrangements if only CITI would provide me with this simple information. They even sent me a screenshot of a computer screen with a lot of information, but not once did they send me something with an IP address or a signature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      1\n",
       "I recently \"bought\" a car with a sticker price of $ 12,000.00. Under the pretext that it was a financed loan. Once all the paperwork was finished, the final cost of the vehicle became {$ 35000.00} and it was not Then, after 5 years of paying for the vehicle, I would have to return the vehicle and pay any depreciation cost. Also, if I return before the end of the lease term, I am still responsible for the cost of the vehicle. Or if I return the vehicle and I stop paying it, this would seriously damage my credit.

       "I bought a bedroom set at Macy's. If you opened a credit card account, they waived an exorbitant shipping charge. I gave him the delivery address. It just did not occur to me that I had to give my post office box and Macy's agent did not ask me about a mailing address; that is, they assumed that the delivery address was the email address. This is simply a mutual error. Months later, I received a phone call that demanded a payment over the phone. I refused to make a payment over the phone without seeing a copy of the invoice.\\nMacy's closed my account at that time, which has put a stop on my credit report. They refused to discuss the late charge until I made a payment. Macy 's did not proceed in good faith. The Macy's collection agent made a decision about me based on my refusal to make a payment that was wrong.\\nThe damage to my credit report can not be fixed because a mortgage loan is in process. My concern is for the other customers who are being harmed by the Macy's scheme to force unsuspecting credit cards at high interest rates in exchange for the delivery charge.\\nThank you XXXX XXXX XXXX PS. The account is paid in full and closed. I called customer service at Macy's and the return call took weeks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
       "Envié una carta de disputa a las agencias (Experian, XXXX y XXXX XXXX) el pasado XXXX 2015 solicitando que eliminen una deuda XXXX de {$ 4000.00} que no me pertenece.

       "In May 2016, I changed insurance companies from XXXX to XXXX XXXX. My annual XXXX rate was {$ 4700.00} and my insurance guarantee payment was {$ 390.00} per month. When I made my renovation, I paid {$ 390.00} during the previous 12 months and had enough money to cover the payment of my annual renewal. I did not have a shortage of custody at that time. I found the cheapest insurance with XXXX XXXX and my annual premium was reduced to {$ 1300.00}. I am aware that my payment in guarantee should now be for insurance {$ 110.00} per month. That's a saving for me {$ 280.00}. The payment of my mortgage should have decreased and the amount of the guarantee payment should also have decreased. I contacted my mortgage servicing company and faxed them the proof of my new insurance and the amount. I also paid XXXX XXXX in the entire premium {$ 1300.00} for one year. My mortgage company did a deposit analysis and told me that I had a shortage in my deposit for the amount minus {$ 1300.00}. I contacted the insurance department of the customer service department of my mortgage company and they informed me that the custody department that my cousin had changed was not notified. And they were told that they were not going to inform the trust. Well, if they do not report the security deposit, that was the reason why I received a statement that I had a shortage. The Nationstar Mortgage is overcharging me and I do not have a shortage of custody. I am aware that the amount that the lender must keep in deposit is only 2 months in reserves, not 12 months in reserves. Nationstar will not adjust the payment of my security deposit and the mortgage and is in violation of Respa's deposit service regulations. Please attend                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               1\n",
