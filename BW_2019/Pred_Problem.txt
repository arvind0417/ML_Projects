1.Tools and packages: scikit-learn, anaconda

2.Language: Python

3.After importing all the required packages, data is loaded in to pandas dataframes(train, test).

4.Created a new feature "date_sent_to_recieved" from other two features("Date-sent-to-company", "Date-received").

5.All the features with date type is converted to int.

6.All the null values for the features is handled.

7.All the features with categorial data values is encoded through LabelEncoder.

8.All the features with large text value is handled with TfidfVectorizer to convert the text data to numeric form and then
to pandas dataframe and then selected only the top features.

9.Merged the dataframe with the newly created dataframe from text feature.

10.Split the total train data to train and test data with 70:30 ratio with train_test_split.

11.Train the model with train data generated from total train data.

12.Tested different Models performance on test data generated from total train data to find the best base model.

13.Did cross-validation through RandomizedSearchCV to find the best fit model with hyperparmeters.

14.Using best estimator predicted complaint status for the test data.
